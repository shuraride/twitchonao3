## Twitch Chat on AO3 (Kinda)

Not 100% accurate. More mimicking the feel than anything. 

Detailed info on how to make changes to this code on the AO3 version.

This repository also includes the CSS/HTML for the AO3 version itself. I sniped some code from the following people/fics to make it:
- [Making a variable-width tooltip for mobile and desktop](https://archiveofourown.org/works/38363089) by Akzeal
- [How to Make a "Choose Your Own Adventure" Fic](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11514573) by La_Temperanza

Original idea for the Twitch chat on AO3 goes to [Ultraviollett](https://archiveofourown.org/collections/ao3_socmed_work_skin/works/40086258).

Feel free to ask me if you can't get something working or have any suggestions! I wrote this all in a day; it's very messy and can definitely be improved.
