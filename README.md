## Twitch Chat on AO3 (Kinda)

Not 100% accurate. More mimicking the feel than anything. Pretty old looking, but that's just Twitch's chat box style. üòÆ‚Äçüí® Rounded corners with drop shadows would make it look more 'modern'.

Detailed info on how to make changes to this code on the [AO3 version](https://archiveofourown.org/works/45107263/chapters/113472118#workskin).

This repository also includes the CSS/HTML for the AO3 version itself. I sniped some code from the following people/fics to make it:
- [Making a variable-width tooltip for mobile and desktop](https://archiveofourown.org/works/38363089) by Akzeal
- [How to Make a "Choose Your Own Adventure" Fic](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11514573) by La_Temperanza
- [Personal Experiment with HTML and CSS (Remove Chapter Titles)](https://archiveofourown.org/collections/A_Guide_to_Coding_and_Fanworks/works/15685086) by MohnblumenKind

Original idea for the Twitch chat on AO3 goes to [Ultraviollett](https://archiveofourown.org/collections/ao3_socmed_work_skin/works/40086258).

Feel free to ask me if you can't get something working or have any suggestions! I wrote this all in a day; it's very messy and can definitely be improved.

P.S. Please don't actually use any of the bear emotes in the HTML. They are not for free use, they're only for example purposes. ü•≤ But [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/kqdrwo/free_emotes/) are some places you can find free or cheap emotes to use! (It's bad practice to use other people's custom Twitch emotes, unless they're explicitly free. Please don't do it.)
